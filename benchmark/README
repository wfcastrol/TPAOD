This directory contains 6 subdirectories with names benchmark_xy, where x=0 and
1<=y<=6. Each of these subdirectories contains a "source" file and a "target"
file. The program computePatchOpt must take these files as input and generate a
patch such that [applyPatch patch source] yields target.

For reference, we provide below the number of lines in each of these files.
